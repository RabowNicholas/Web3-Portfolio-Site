            <p>
                After spending much of my professional life as an electrical engineer, I decided to finally
                pursue my true passion which has always been programming. I went to Weber State University located
                in Northern Utah and received my degree in Computer Engineering. It was here that I discovered my drive
                to create simple solutions to complex issues. Simultaneously, I began to get involved in the cryptocurrency space.
                The techy side of me wanted to see how everything worked under the hood. Not too soon after graduating, I discovered I could combine my
                two highest ranking interests and become a blockchain developer.
